      <article>
        <p><p>This special edition of this blog entry will lack the clarity or loquaciousness of the Spanish entries. I enrolled in this little course about Story Telling and well... the current homework was about writing about your favorite story. Coincidentally that's what this blog is all about. I promise that the following non-homework related entries would go back to Spanish (Or should I say Spanglish?)</p><p>So it's really hard to choose the story you like the most. With what is going on, 1984 would be perfect, but I decided is just better to tell a more "feel-good" story. Ironically enough, the book is super depressing, but I have learned, like the Pavlovian dog, to associate so many good times with it that I can't just not talk about it.</p><p>Crime and Punishment from Fedor Dostoyevski (or any of the many possible spellings of the same name) starts with the Rodya Raskolnikov. A university student that believes humanity is split in two kinds. The ones that keep society in the it's current form and the revolutionaries, the ones that keep the society going forward. Rodya feels both groups are necessary to create some sort of homeostasis. A balance that prevents anarchy but also stagnation.</p><p>The revolutionaries, being the ones that actually move the society to new and better ways, should be excused to break the rules, if that allows them to pursue their altruistic goals. Because of that, Rodya, identifying himself as part of that kind decides that in his best interest to murder and old and not very kind moneylender to get enough resources to survive his precarious situation, but also to pursue his altruistic goals. The rest of the plot, describes how redemption is achieved after a crime is committed.</p><p>So this is quite uplifting, isn't it? Well, actually this was one of the very first books I ever read that were not mandatory in my high school. The very first classic I just feel like reading, and the reason is simple. A girl.</p><p>There was this girl in the school bus I really liked. Me, being the socially awkward nerd I was just not able to say a single word to her, but when I finally dared, I discovered this one was from the smart kind. We spent hours talking about so many things and among those she told me that for some reason I reminded her Rodya Raskolnikov. Well, my teenager testosterone levels did the rest. I read the book, I liked it and there you go. Some material for the "Get" part of your 3-act-love-archplot.</p></p>
